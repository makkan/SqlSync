* To compile, mvn clean install
* Run with java -jar target/SqlSync.jar <sqlsync.json> where sqlsync.json:
{
  "verbose":"verbose", -- Log to system out
  "syncList":[{ -- Can be a list of databases to be synced
    "dbHost":"localhost", -- Which host
    "dbName":"test", -- Which database
    "dbUser":"root", -- User with adim rights, needs to be able to drop and create procedures
    "dbPassword":"", -- User password
    "scriptFilePath":"C:/database", -- Where the scripts are located
    "executeScript":"executeScript" -- If empty string, no script will be executed against the database, only the version_history table will be updated
  }]
}
* The scripts must numbered from 1.sql - n.sql
* The scripts will be executed in order
* The scripts will only be executed once
* If a script fails, it will be rollbacked, all sql statements are executed within a transaction
* The scripts must be welformed, end all DELIMETERS, example:
DELIMITER $$
CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `test`(
    IN testInput TINYINT )
BEGIN
 
 DECLARE test1 INT;
 DECLARE test2 DATETIME;
 ...
 ...
END $$ -- Ending with the correct delimiter
DELIMITER ;
